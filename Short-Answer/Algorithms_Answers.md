#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

O(n) - a equals n**3 after the code runs n times so the while loop stops

b)

O(n log(n)) - The outer for loop is O(n) because it runs n times. The inner while loop is O(log n) because j doubles everytime it runs.
Because of this it's O(n) * O(log n) = O(n log(n))

c)

O(n) - This recursive code runs as often as the number of bunnies as input.
